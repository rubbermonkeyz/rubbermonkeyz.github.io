**Hey there!** I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Alberta, pursuing a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Mathematical Physics. Here's what I've been up to:

**Personal Projects**
- **vectorcalc** (Python Package)
  - Created this cool Python package for numerical line integrals.
  - Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/xan3c/vectorcalc) or [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vectorcalc/).

- **Too Many Questions** (Blog)
  - I run a blog where I discuss math, computer science, data science, and physics.
  - Dive in at [toomanyquestions.ca](https://www.toomanyquestions.ca/).

**Get in Touch**
- Drop me a line anytime at whatis@kennymoc.xyz!
